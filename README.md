# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

This python project employs scikit-learn to classify whether a person has cardiovascular disease or not. The goal of the project was to determine whether modern machine learning libraries were effective in the field of healthcare. 

Following Google's recent advancement with AI to detect breast cancer, this project tries to emulate that process in other diseases, in this case, cardiovascular ones. 

More documentation of the code can be found inside the .pynb file.

## Datasets used

This project makes use of the dataset found on kaggle which consists of 70,000 records of patients data. 

* [Cardiovascular Disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset)

### Note: 
There was a problem with trying getting the data into the right format, i.e. the columns would not separate. To fix this, simply go into excel and under Data tools in the data tab, click on "Text to Columns", select your data type as delimited, and your delimiters as semicolon, then click finish. You can then exit and save your file as .csv and it should be fixed.
