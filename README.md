# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

This python project employs scikit-learn to classify whether a person has cardiovascular disease or not. The goal of the project was to determine whether modern machine learning libraries were effective in the field of healthcare. 

Following Google's recent advancement with AI to detect breast cancer, this project tries to emulate that process in other diseases, in this case, cardiovascular ones.
